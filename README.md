# Submodule_POC
This repository is to test submodules. There are two submodule used in this example: feature1, and feature2. Both have includes are imported into the main file and defines are printed out to show that they're being used.

A caveat of this setup is that both feature modules are branches in the same (this) repository. So they have been put in separate folders to avoid name conflicts.

## Helpful Links
- [Here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) is the reference guide for the commands.
- [Here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) are more detailed instructions from the git v2 book.

## Commands

These instructions assume that you are already in a git repository.

### Clone

`git clone --recurse-submodules <URL>`

To clone a repository and all of it's submodules.

### Add

`git submodule add [-b <branch>] [--name <name>] <URL> [<path>]`

Adds a git repository to the current repository. Note that with the path it will create the subdirectory for you.

### Move

`git mv <source dir> <destination dir>`

Git support `mv` as in linux. You can therefore move submodule directories if included into the wrong path.

### Update

`git submodule update --remote`

Update all submodules.

```
cd <submodule>
git pull <branch>
```

Update individual submodules.

## C++ .vscode Configuration
Sometimes setting up the environment for C/C++ can be annoying, here are the .vscode file settings I used. After following [these](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites) steps to install a compiler.

### launch.json
```
